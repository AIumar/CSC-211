	 Linking to a Specific Point in a Page
Did you know you can link to a specific point in a web page? This is useful
for providing shortcuts to information at the bottom of a long, scrolling page
or for getting back to the top of a page with just one click or tap. Linking to a
specific point in the page is also known as linking to a document fragment.
Linking to a particular spot within a page is a two-part process. First, identify
the destination, and then make a link to it. In the following example, I create
an alphabetical index at the top of the page that links down to each alpha-
betical section of a glossary page (FIGURE 6-11). When users click the letter H,
they’ll jump to the “H” heading lower on the page.</p>

	<p>Step 1: Identifying the destination
I like to think of this step as planting a flag in the document so I can get back
to it easily. To create a destination, use the id attribute to give the target ele-
ment in the document a unique name (that’s “unique” as in the name may
appear only once in the document, not “unique” as in funky and interesting).
In web lingo, this is the fragment identifier.
You may remember the id attribute from Chapter 5, Marking Up Text, where
we used it to name generic div and span elements. Here, we’re going to use it
to name an element so that it can serve as a fragment identifier—that is, the
destination of a link.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of the source for the glossary page. Because I want users to
be able to link directly to the “H” heading, I’ll add the id attribute to it and
give it the value “startH” (FIGURE 6-11 1):
<h2 id="startH">H</h2>
Step 2: Linking to the destination
With the identifier in place, now I can make a link to it.
At the top of the page, I’ll create a link down to the “startH” fragment 2. As for
any link, I use the a element with the href attribute to provide the location of
the link. To indicate that I’m linking to a fragment, I use the octothorpe symbol
(#), also called a hash, pound, or number symbol, before the fragment name:
<p>... F | G | <a href="#startH">H</a> | I | J ...</p>
And that’s it. Now when someone clicks the H from the listing at the top of
the page, the browser will jump down and display the section starting with
the “H” heading 3.

	Writing Pathnames to Images
The src attribute in the img element works the same as the href attribute in
anchors. Because you’ll most likely be using images from your own server, the
src attributes within your image elements will be set to relative URLs.
Let’s look at a few examples from the Jen’s Kitchen site. First, to add an image
to the index.html page, you’d use the following markup:</p>
<p><img src="images/jenskitchen.gif" alt="">
The URL says, “Look in the current directory (jenskitchen) for the images
directory; in there you will find jenskitchen.gif.”
Now for the pièce de résistance. Let’s add an image to the file couscous.html:
<img src="../../images/spoon.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>This is a little more complicated than what we’ve seen so far. This pathname
tells the browser to go up two directory levels to the top-level directory and,
once there, look in the images directory for an image called spoon.gif. Whew!
Of course, you could simplify that path by going the site root relative route, in
which case the pathname to spoon.gif (and any other file in the images direc-
tory) could be accessed like this:
<img src="/images/spoon.gif" alt=""></p><p>
The trade-off is that you won’t see the image in place until the site is uploaded
to the server, but it does make maintenance easier once it’s there.
